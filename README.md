# Data Science Exercise for Data Scientist II
 
## Challenge

Evaluate how well we have been supporting our customers over the last few quarters.

## Assets Produced 

To complete this exercise the following assets were produced: 

1. **satisfaction.ipynb** -> Final notebook to be considered where a classifier is trained to predict ticket satisfaction
2. **Looker Dashboard** -> Dashboard used to answer the main question "how well are we supporting our customers?". I attached a pdf but feel free to ask me the actual dashboard link.
3. **Pitch presentation** -> to communicate approach, solution and limitations.  
4. **exercise.ipyn** -> basically a scrap book where I tried several approaches that I was not satisfied with the end result. I tried to predict FullResolutionTime with Regression Algorithms and group agents with K-Means Clustering.
